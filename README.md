This repository implement various data structures and algorithms for general use

## Linked list
### Singly linked list
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is singly-linked list if every element contains some data and a link to the next element, which allows to keep the structure. 

### Circular linked list
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is a circular linked list if it is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence and the last element has a link to the first element in the sequence.

### Doubly linked list
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is doubly-linked list if it is a singly-linked list and in addition every node in it also contains a link to the previous node.

### Directed Graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is directed if edge (x,y) ∈ E does NOT impliy that (y,x) is also in E

### Undirected graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is undirected if edge (x,y) ∈ E implies that (y,x) is also in E

### Weighted graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is weighted if it have a weight, or number, associated with each edge E. Some algorithms require all weights to be nonnegative, integral, positive, etc. Also known as edge-weighted graph.

### Unweighted graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is unweighted if it do not have a weight, or number, associated with each edge E.

### Simple graph
Definition: A simple graph G = (V,E), also called a strict graph is an unweighted, undirected graph G containing no graph loops or multiple edges. A simple graph may be either connected or disconnected.
