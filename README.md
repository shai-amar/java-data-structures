This repository implement various data structures and algorithms for general use

## Linked list
### Singly linked list
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is singly-linked list if every element contains some data and a link to the next element, which allows to keep the structure.

### Circular linked list
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is a circular linked list if it is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence and the last element has a link to the first element in the sequence.

### Doubly linked list
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is doubly-linked list if it is a singly-linked list and in addition every node in it also contains a link to the previous node.

## Stacks and Queues
### Stack
Definition: Stack is an ordered list of similar data type. Stack is a **LIFO** structure. (Last in First out). **push()** function is used to insert new elements into the Stack and **pop()** is used to delete an element from the stack. Both insertion and deletion are allowed at only one end of Stack called **Top**.

### Regular queue
Definition: Queue is also an abstract data type or a linear data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called REAR(also called tail), and the deletion of exisiting element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head). This makes queue as FIFO data structure, which means that element inserted first will also be removed first.

The process to add an element into queue is called **Enqueue** and the process of removal of an element from queue is called **Dequeue**.

### Directed Graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is directed if edge (x,y) ∈ E does NOT impliy that (y,x) is also in E

### Undirected graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is undirected if edge (x,y) ∈ E implies that (y,x) is also in E

### Weighted graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is weighted if it have a weight, or number, associated with each edge E. Some algorithms require all weights to be nonnegative, integral, positive, etc. Also known as edge-weighted graph.

### Unweighted graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is unweighted if it do not have a weight, or number, associated with each edge E.

### Simple graph
Definition: A simple graph G = (V,E), also called a strict graph is an unweighted, undirected graph G containing no graph loops or multiple edges. A simple graph may be either connected or disconnected.
