### Directed Graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is directed if edge (x,y) ∈ E does NOT impliy that (y,x) is also in E
![Alt text](/images/directed_graph.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

### Undirected graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is undirected if edge (x,y) ∈ E implies that (y,x) is also in E
### Weighted graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is weighted if it have a weight, or number, associated with each edge E. Some algorithms require all weights to be nonnegative, integral, positive, etc. Also known as edge-weighted graph.
### Unweighted graph
Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is unweighted if it do not have a weight, or number, associated with each edge E.
### Simple graph
Definition: A simple graph G = (V,E), also called a strict graph is an unweighted, undirected graph G containing no graph loops or multiple edges. A simple graph may be either connected or disconnected.
### Non simple graph
### Sparse graph
### Dense graph
### Cyclic graph
### Acyclic graph
### Embedded graph
### Topological graph
### Implicit graph
