Key-Value store

When I'll have time I need to create an article avout key-value store and what it means.

these are the following questions that occurs to me:
1. what is a hash function?
2. what is a hash collision?
3. how to implement a hash function?
4. what is a load factor?
5. what is a rehash and when do you do it?
6. how the value (from key-value) is implemented? single value? buckets?


A good explanation about hash function: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9364134/what-hashing-function-does-java-use-to-implement-hashtable-class
This url gives a good description about hashtable: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html
